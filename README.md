# Onondaga_trends
Motivation:
Over the next twenty years, Micron Technology plans to spend up to $100 billion building the nation’s largest semiconductor fabrication facility in Syracuse’s northern suburbs. This historic investment is motivated by New York’s Green CHIPS Program which offers up to $10 billion in economic incentives for environmentally friendly semiconductor manufacturing and supply chain projects. Cross-sector investments in the semiconductor industry are expected to create transformational economic development, job growth, and fiscal mobility in the Central New York Region. However, many residents may be disadvantaged by an increase in the cost of living, property taxes, and unable to relocate. The goal of this project is to identify communities in Onondaga County that are the most vulnerable to gentrification at the census tract level. 

This project aims to:
•	Identify households in Onondaga County that will be most affected by agglomeration and increased property taxes.
•	Locate communities that are traditionally underrepresented in tech in Onondaga County. 
•	To inform the public administration of Green CHIPS funding so that Onondaga County delivers on its promise for inclusive growth and economic development.

Instructions:
This project uses Python to clean and merge datasets; QGIS to build maps; “””and Tableau to make the final neighborhood-level results accessible to a wider audience.”””
